This is a script that works but it's simple. It doesn't do smart ps checking
for wpa_supplicant already running, so make sure you kill that and turn off
NetworkManager before running this. When I get some time I'll come back to this
and make it less trash.

You will also need to generate an NTLM hash of your RIT password to do this 
unless you want to keep a copy of your password in the .conf file.

Put the rit.conf file in /etc/wpa_supplicant before running the script.
